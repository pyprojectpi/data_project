### ✨ Changes made:
- **Horizontal flow (LR)** instead of vertical so it reads left-to-right like a conversation.
- **Added sub-labels** under each node for clarity.
- **More emojis** for personality.
- **Clearer arrows** with labels describing what is happening.

If you want, I can make a **full-color PNG diagram** from this Mermaid chart so your GitHub README looks premium without relying on GitHub's Mermaid rendering. That will work everywhere, even where Mermaid isn’t supported.  

Do you want me to prepare that image for you?
