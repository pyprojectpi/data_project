# üß† Employee Attrition Analysis using Logistic Regression

## üìå Problem Statement

Employee attrition (churn) is a significant challenge in any organization. Retaining valuable employees is crucial for company growth, performance, and cost management.  
The goal of this project is to **predict whether an employee will leave the company or not**, based on various features like:

- Age  
- Monthly Income  
- Job Role  
- Distance from Home  
- Job Satisfaction  
- Promotion in Last 5 Years  
- Years at Company  
... and more.

We use a **Logistic Regression model** to identify and interpret which factors influence attrition the most.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates how Logistic Regression can be used to identify and predict employee attrition with good accuracy. From the feature importance, we can see that **Work-Life Balance, OverTime, Age, and Job Role** significantly influence attrition decisions.

Such insights help HR teams **design better retention strategies** and take proactive steps to improve employee satisfaction and reduce attrition rates.

## üöÄ Future Improvements

- Use advanced models like Random Forest, XGBoost, or Neural Networks  
- Hyperparameter tuning  
- Use SHAP for more interpretable feature contributions  
- Build a Streamlit app to allow HR teams to input employee info and get predictions live
